## Andric's Dotfiles
This is a project that I use to put all my dotfiles on my mac computer. I prefer Mac's so that's what I use. 

## Requirements

**How to use**

There are a few things that you should have by default if you're to use these .dotfiles.

First you'll want to install a few applications which aren't hard to do.

* XCode (App store)
* Commandline tools (preferances > downloads > components > Command Line Tools > Install)
* MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/)
* TextWrangler & Command line tools (http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) 
* Drush (If you do Drupal development)
