Basically tar can be used to group multiple files/directories into one single 
file, and separate(extract) an archive created by tar into separate files.

* To group multiple files : tar -cvf foo.tar a.dat b.dat c.dat (this will group 
files [a-c]*.dat to one file foo.tar )
	c = create a tar file
	v = verbose( nothing important  )
	f = create the tar file with filename provided as the argument

Thats all you need to know to tar(group) a bunch of files/directories.

-- This will create a gzip-compressed Tar file of the name foo.tar.gz 
   of all files with a .dat suffix in that directory)
* To tar files and gzip them : tar -czf foo.tar.gz *.dat 
* To untar(separate) files from a tar archive : tar -xvf foo.tar
  (this will produce three separate files a.dat, b.dat and c.dat)
* To untar(extract) a gzipped tar archive file : tar -xzf foo.tar.gz
* To untar a bzipped (.bz2) tar archive file : tar -xjf foo.tar.bz2


To Tar
tar -zcvf

To Untar a file
tar -zxvf

To Untar multiple files
for i in *.tar.gz; do tar -xvf $i; done
