## Andric's Dotfiles
This is a project that I use to put all my dotfiles on my mac computer. I prefer Mac's so that's what I use. 

## Requirements
### Git
To "git" stuff.
### Macports (or some equivalent)
To install a bunch of useful binaries.

## TODO
* Create a custom mrpotatoes-project.el based, on features, on mk-project.
* Add back some of my netbeans keybindings that I miss.
* Perhaps see what's up with the super key on OSX.
* Figure out profiles
* Try out C Sub Word. I saw something about this that I'd like to check out.
* Fix the "MAKEFILE"
