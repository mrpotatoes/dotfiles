Purpose: This file does a lot that with a hosts file that allows us to manage many hosts.
    First it allows two different hosts. One is a "work" hosts file that doesn't allow
    certain sites. They all forward to localhost. This, hopefully, will keep you focused.
    There are some default hosts in that file as well. It also allows you to revert back.
    
    Secondly this file will allow you to modify the actual hosts file from a simple 
    command. This requires sudo access, of course, but is powerful so as to not have to 
    open up the file. It will back up all the data to the $DOTFILES/data/hosts directory 
    under the format of: etc-hosts.hh-dd-mm-yyyyy.txt. Assuming that you don't need to
    modify your hosts file more than once an hour. If that's the case then data will be 
    clobbered. 
    
    Lastly this script will allow you to restore a backup of your hosts file in case 
    you need to blowing away any data that is currently in /etc/hosts. If all else fails
    edit it manually.
