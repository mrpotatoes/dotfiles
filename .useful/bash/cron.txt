| */5	  |	Is treated as every 5 minutes, hours, days, or months. Replacing the 5 		   |
|	  |	with another numerical value will change this option.				   |
+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2,4,6   |	Treated as an OR, so if placed in the hours, this could mean at 2, 4, or 6 o-clock |
+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 9-17	  |	Treats for any value between 9 and 17. So if placed in day of month this would be  |
|	  |	days 9 through 17. Or if put in hours it would be between 9 and 5.		   |
